### ProjectZero - Lanesplitting 101
# Overview

Good Monday morning… it’s time to brave the Bay Area traffic once again and get to General Assembly. Hop on your motorcycle and make your way around and through traffic. And because this is California, when traffic slows down you can lanesplit between cars. But watch out for cars shifting in their lanes, changing lanes, and generally trying to kill you.
